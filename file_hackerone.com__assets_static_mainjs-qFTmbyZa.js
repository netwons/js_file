`,cJ='# Overview - Pentest Details and Rules\n* The pentest team size is of `2 pentesters` `3 pentesters` `4 pentesters` `5 pentesters`\n* The pentest will have `Web Application Pentest` `API Pentest` `Infrastructure Pentest` `Mobile Application Testing` and `Thick Application Pentest` in scope. More details can be found in the next section `mandatory - remove out of scope assessments`\n* Any special instructions associated with the attack surface that might affect testing effort? `accessing through VPN, throttling, or accessing the application at specific times`\n* Black-box or Gray-box or White-box Testing? `mandatory`\n\n# This pentest will include the following assets in scope:\n___\n\n## Web Application Pentest `Remove this section if not scope`\n#### Web Application 1\n* Black-box or Gray-box or White-box Testing? `mandatory`\n* Short description of the functionality and business purpose of the application `indicate if it is not applicable or could not get information on this`\n* How many user roles? `mandatory if gray-box`\n* Self account creation or providing accounts `mandatory if gray-box`\n* How many pages/functions approximately? `indicate if it is not applicable or could not get information on this`\n\n[Add more Web Applications as required repeating the previous information]\n\n___\n\n## API Pentest `Remove this section if not scope`\n* Black-box or Gray-box or White-box Testing? `mandatory`\n* API Documentation such as Swagger or Postman Collection etc. will be provided? `mandatory`\n* Number of API endpoints `mandatory`\n* Average number of parameters per API endpoint `indicate if it is not applicable or could not get information on this`\n* Number of user roles/types `mandatory if gray-box`\n\n___\n\n##External Infrastructure Pentest `Remove this section if not scope`\n* Number of IP Addresses in scope `mandatory` - Be specific in this, if it is an IP range write in the Netmask `/24` or `/16`. If the customer only indicates "full" range for X.X.X.X, we will assume it to be `/24` and indicate as such.\n* Average number of services live in each host (FTP, DNS, Web App, SSH etc.). `indicate if it is not applicable or could not get information on this`\n*Note: Only Live IPs is not enough. We need to know how many assets need to be scanned. If 300 Live IPs, the total IP addresses to scan could be 300 or 3000. The amount of time that it takes varies by quite a bit\n\n___\n\n## Mobile Application Pentest `Remove this section if not scope`\n#### Mobile Application 1\n* Black-box or Gray-box or White-box Testing? `mandatory`\n* Short description of the functionality and business purpose of the application `indicate if it is not applicable or could not get information on this`\n* Will you be providing a version of the mobile application with security controls disabled? (Root detection, code obfuscation, SSL Pinning etc.) `mandatory`\n* How many user roles? `mandatory`\n* How many pages/functions approximately? `indicate if it is not applicable or could not get information on this`\n\n[Add more Mobile Applications as required]\n\n___\n\n## Thick Application Pentest `Remove this section if not scope`\n#### Thick Application 1\n* Black-box or Gray-box or White-box Testing?
